# Discord Assistant

### What is this?

This is a project to fully integrate Google Assistant within Discord voice channels. Currently, it is able to listen for
voice wake commands ("OK, Google") and reply using the Google Assistant SDK.

It's capable of storing authentication credentials for multiple Google accounts, listening to multiple users at once
within a voice channel, and replying only with information from their own personal Assistant.

I plan to further develop this project and turn it into a bot ready for mass use.
