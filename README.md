# Discord Assistant

### What is this?
This is a project to fully integrate Google Assistant within Discord voice channels.
Currently, it is able to listen for voice wake commands ("OK, Google") and reply using the Google Assistant SDK.

However, it is not currently capable of storing multiple Google account credentials, and as such it should be used as nothing more than an interesting tech demo in its current state. I plan to further develop this project and turn it into a bot ready for mass use.
